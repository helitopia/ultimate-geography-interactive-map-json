Notes:

JSON file with GeoJson strings -> compile to JSON with SVGs of different detail levels (depending on zoom map of different details is used)

In interactive map make npm dependency on released JSON with SVG paths

Release TS types for JSON (npm install json-schema-to-typescript)

TODO add validation of region references (both for region and territory references)
TODO add schema descriptions
